<h1>My Personal Story</h1>
<p>Before I became a 10th grader, I used t  play Age of Empires II.That game messed up my grades and the creativity was limited greatly. Code gave me more freedom in terms of creativity (as with code you can make anything) when I learned code. Without learning code, I wouldn't be able to make this personal story assignment, ArcherCraft, a good grade from balancing hobbies and school, and  I would do what 'followers' do when someone skips (or cuts ) classes.\</p>
