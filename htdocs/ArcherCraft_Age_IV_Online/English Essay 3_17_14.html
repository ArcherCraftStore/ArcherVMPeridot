<p>imagine a time where you couldn't afford Microsoft Word and you had to type an assignment. Code is what makes this this assignment possible and also is helpful for getting work done. The schools should have an afterschool open code program as it builds word processing autobiographical and rational thinking skills</p>
<p>One reason I believe there should be an open code program is for the development of word processing skills. For example ,Codecademy says
:<blockquote cite="http://www.codecademy.com/blog"> <div class="Blogtent"> Liz was laid off from her administrative position this past November, and at 55 &ndash;  without a college degree &ndash; she needed a way to make her resume stand a chance. Key web coding skills such as JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby, HTML/CSS, and Python helped shoot her to the head of the queue. What else? "My daily hard work on Codecademy gave me a feeling of competence, which helped me to be confident and knowledgeable in my interviews."</div><br><br><div class="Blogtent">Tim's office at the University of York uses Google Forms to automate housing transfer requests from thousands of students. After a few lessons he used JavaScript to write a Google Apps Script that sends a confirmation email as well, and that project slowly grew into building an entire dashboard to manage the transfer process from start to finish. The result? A nice promotion to the Data Analysis team, and a big boost of confidence.</div><br><br><div class"Blogtent">While working in the music industry, Jennifer started dabbling in web development and noticed that the hours seemed to pass quicker than before. She decided to move from a full-time position in music to working as an intern and studying in the evenings &ndash; but, she says, "this really accelerated my learning. During the day, I continued to improve my HTML and CSS skills while I worked on the Codecademy JavaScript and jQuery coursework in the evenings." Slowly but surely she became a full-time staff developer and now works at a SaaS startup.</div></blockquote><cite>(Codecademy) </cite> these people have learned a word processing  skill that has either brought them to the top of their company, has brought them a nice job, or has made them a Developer.</p>
<p>Another reason I believe Code should be an afterschool program as it also helps colleges, and universities find students. For example, Codecademy says: <blockquote cite="http://www.codecademy.com/afterschool"><p>Technology is radically changing every area of our society, from communication to government to how we do our jobs. Digital literacy is now a fundamental skill like reading and writing.</p>

<p>By learning to program, kids can have a say in how software shapes their world. Plus, programming teaches important reasoning, logic, and communication skills</p></blockquote><cite></cite> This is helpful for when you have a resume fot a job or when you're off to college</p>

<p>&nsbp; &nsbp;I Also believe code should be an afterschool program as this can help improve thinking skills. For example, in Mozilla Developer Network:<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction"> "In the late 1980s, Tim Berners-Lee was working as a physicist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). He devised a way for scientists to share documents over the internet. Prior to his invention, communication via the internet was limited to plain text, using technologies such as email, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and Usenet-based discussion boards. The invention of HTML made use of a model of content stored on a central server that could be transferred and displayed on a local workstation via a browser. It simplified access to content and enabled the display of "rich" content (such as sophisticated text formatting and the display of images)."</blockquote><cite>(Mozilla Developer Network)</cite> The use of other subjects in coding helps you think about the design of a certain web page. When you use Notes and Essays , HTML Comes in Handy. </p>

Although it is outside the scope of this article to discuss hacker culture, most hackers have not been criminals in the sense of being vandals or of seeking illicit financial rewards. Instead, most have been young people driven by intellectual curiosity; many of these people have gone on to become computer security architects. However, as some hackers sought notoriety among their peers, their exploits led to clear-cut crimes.</blockquote> as said by Encyclopedia Britannica. This is not true, however This is not true , however, as  in society , we must teach the right ways of web development-becoming found,doing work, or talking about our skill of a certain subject.(From my personal experience)</p></div><div data-role="page" id="Essay_Conclusion"><div data-role="header"><h1>Conclusion Page</h1></div><div data-role="main" class="ui-content"><div data-role="navbar"><ul><li><a href="#Essaypage1">Page 1</a></li><li><a href="#Essaypage2">Page 2</a></li><li><a href="Essay_page-3">Page</a></li></ul></div> Overall, coding should be an afterschool program as coding can become a word processing skill , can help you get found, and can help develop refined logical skills.The Word proceesing skills are developed when using formatting, CSS, and the "p" tag. The The Pages produced from open code can be placed onto a domain, or website to help that person be found by colleges, universities ,and even employers.The lesson from this Essay is this:<br><br>
