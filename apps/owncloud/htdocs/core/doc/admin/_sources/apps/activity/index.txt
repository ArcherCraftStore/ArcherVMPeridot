Activity
========

The ownCloud Activity app shows an activity feed where users can see what they did in the past and what happened to
their files and what others did with their shared files.

The Activity Stream introduces a central interface where all events that happen in a user’s ownCloud instance are shown.

The following can be seen in the new interface:

*   Creation, edit or deletion of files along with a thumbnail and date and path
*   If someone shared a file with you
*   If someone created, edited or deleted something in a folder you shared to them.

All the events are presented with endless scrolling and also in an RSS feed which a user can subscribe to.

Configuration
=============

The Activity App is enabled by default.  To verify or to disable, navigate to the APPS page and search for ``Activity``.
