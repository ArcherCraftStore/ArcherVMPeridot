Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008
---------------------------------

.. note:: You must move the data directory outside of your public root (See
          advanced install settings)

This section describes how to install ownCloud on Windows with :abbr:`IIS
(Internet Information Services)`.

It assumes that you have a vanilla, non-IIS enabled Windows
machine – Windows 7 or Server 2008. After enabling IIS, the steps are
essentially identical for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.

For installing ownCloud physical access or a remote desktop connection is
required. You should leverage MySQL as the backend database for ownCloud. If you
do not want to use MySQL, it is possible to use Postgres or SQLite instead.
Microsoft SQL Server is not yet support.

Enabling SSL is not yet covered by this section.

.. note:: If you make your desktop machine or server available outside of your
          LAN, you must maintain it. Monitor the logs, manage the access, apply patches to
          avoid compromising the system at large.

There are 4 primary steps to the installation, and then a 5th step
required for configuring everything to allow files larger than the
default 2MB.

#. Install IIS with CGI support – enable IIS on your Windows machine.
#. Install PHP – Grab, download and install PHP.
#. Install MySQL – Setup the MySQL server manager and enable ownCloud to create
   an instance.
#. Install ownCloud – The whole reason we are here!
#. Configure upload sizes and timeouts to enable large file uploads – So that
   you can upload larger files.

Activate IIS with CGI Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Windows 7
^^^^^^^^^

#. Go to :guilabel:`Start --> Control Panel --> Programs`.
#. Under Programs and Features, there is link titled :guilabel:`Turn Windows Features on
   and Off`. Click on it.
#. There is a box labeled Internet Information Services, expand it.
#. Expand World Wide Web Services and all the folders underneath.
#. Select the folders as illustrated in the picture below to get your IIS
   server up and running.

    Windows Features required for ownCloud on Windows 7

You do not need an FTP server running, so you should tune
that feature off for your server. You definitely need the IIS Management
Console, as that is the easiest way to start, stop, restart you server,
as well as where you change certificate options and manage items like
file upload size. You must check the CGI box under Application
Development Features, because CGI is how you enable PHP on IIS.

You have to turn off WebDAV publishing or the Windows WebDAV
conflicts with the ownCloud WebDAV interface. This might already be
turned off for you, just make sure it stays that way. The common HTTP
features are the features you would expect from a web server.
With the selections on this page, IIS will now serve up a web page for you.

Restart IIS by going to the IIS manager (:guilabel:`Start --> IIS Manager`).

Select your website, and on the far right side is a section titled
:guilabel:`Manage Server`. Make sure that the service is started, or click
:guilabel:`Start` to start the services selected. Once this is complete, you
should be able to go to a web browser and navigate to http://localhost.

This should open the standard IIS 7 splash page, which is just a static image
that says your web server is running. Assuming you were able to get the
splash page, it is safe to say your web server is now up and running.


Windows Server 2008
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Go to :guilabel:`Start --> Control Panel --> Programs`.
#. Under Programs and Features, there is link titled
   :guilabel:`Turn Windows Features on and Off`. Click on it.
#. This will bring up the Server Manager.
#. In the server manager, Click on Roles, and then click Add Roles.
#. Use the :guilabel:`Add Roles Wizard` to add the web server role.

6. Make sure that, at a minimum, the same boxes are checked in this wizard that
   are checked in the Windows 7 Section. For example, make sure that the CGI box
   is checked under Application Development Features, and that WebDAV Publishing
   is turned off. With Remote Desktop Sharing turned on, the detailed role
   service list looks like the figure “Role Services”.
7. Restart IIS by going to the IIS manager (:guilabel:`Start --> IIS Manager`).
8. Select your website, and on the far right side is a section titled Manage
   server. Make sure that the service is started, or click “Start” to start the
   services selected.

9. Once this is complete, you should be able to go to a web browser and type
   `localhost`. This should open the standard IIS 7 splash page, which is just a
   static image that says your web server is running.Assuming you were able to get
   the splash page, it is safe to say your web server is now up and running. The
   next part of this “how to” installs PHP on the server.

Installing PHP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part is also straightforward, but it is necessary to remind you that this
is for IIS only.

1. Go to the following link and grab the `PHP installer
   <http://windows.php.net/download/>`_ for version "VC9 Non Thread Safe" 32 or
   64 bit based on your system.

.. note:: If you are using Apache, make sure you grab VC6 instead, lower on the page.

2. Once through that login, select the location that is closest to you
   geographically.
3. Run that install wizard once it is downloaded. Read the license agreement,
   agree, select an install directory.
4. Then select IIS FastCGI as the install server. 
5. Take the default selections for the items to install, and click next.
   Then click `install`.
6. After a few minutes, PHP will be installed. On to MySQL.

Installing MySQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This part installs MySQL on your Windows machine.

#. Point your browser to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ and download the latest
   community edition for your OS – the 32 or 64 bit version. Please download the
   **MSI Installer** as it will make life easier.
#. Once downloaded, install MySQL (5.5 at the time of writing). Select the
   Typical installation.
#. When that finishes, check the box to launch the MySQL Instance Configuration
   Wizard and click Finish.
#. Select a standard configuration, as this will be the only version of MySQL on
   this machine.
#. Select to install as a windows service, and Check the Launch the MySQL Server
   Automatically button.
#. Select the modify security settings box on the next page, and enter a
   password you will remember. You will need this password when you configure
   ownCloud.
#. Uncheck **enable** root access from remote machines” for security reasons.
#. Click execute, and wait while the instance is created and launched.
#. Click Finish when this is all complete.

.. You can make some pretty good educated guesses on the type of install needed for ownCloud. %% That's not really useful, clarify!

Take particular note of your MySQL password, as the user name **root**
and the password you select will be necessary later on in the ownCloud
installation. As an aside, this link is an excellent resource for questions on
how to configure your MySQL instance, and also to configure PHP to work with
MySQL. This, however, is not strictly necessary as much of this is handled when
you download ownCloud.

More information in this topic can be found in a `tutorial on the IIS web site`_.

Installing ownCloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the latest version of ownCloud from http://owncloud.org/download.
2. It will arrive as a tar.bz2 file, and I recommend something like jZip for a
   free utility to unzip it.
3. Once you have the ownCloud directory unzipped and saved locally, copy it into
   your wwwroot directory (probably **C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot**).

.. note:: You cannot install directly into the directory **wwwroot** from jzip,
          as only the administrator can unzip into the **wwwroot** directory. If you save
          it in a different folder, and then move the files into **wwwroot** in windows
          explorer, it works. This will install ownCloud locally in your root web
          directory. You can use a subdirectory called owncloud, or whatever you want –
          the www root, or something else.

4. It is now time to give write access to the ownCloud directory to the ownCloud
   server: Navigate your windows explorer over to  **inetpub/wwwroot/owncloud** (or
   your installation directory if you selected something different).
5. Right click and select properties. Click on the security tab, and click the
   button “to change permissions, click edit”.
6. Select the “users” user from the list, and check the box “write”.
7. Apply these settings and close out.
8. Now open your browser and go to http://localhost/owncloud (or localhost if it
   is installed in the root www directory). This should bring up the ownCloud
   configuration page.
9. At this page, you enter your desired ownCloud user name and password for the
   administrator, and expand the little arrow.
10. Select MySQL as the database, and enter your MySQL database user name,
    password and desired instance name – use the user name and password you setup
    for MySQL earlier in step 3, and pick any name for the database instance.

.. note:: The ownCloud admin password and the MySQL password CANNOT be the same
          in any way.

11. Click next, and ownCloud should have you logged in as the admin user, and
    you can get started exploring ownCloud, creating other users and more!

Ensure Proper HTTP-Verb handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

IIS must pass all HTTP and WebDAV verbs to the PHP/CGI handler, and must not try
to handle them by itself. If it does, syncing with the Desktop and Mobile
Clients will fail. Here is how to ensure your configuration is correct:

#. Open IIS Manager7.
#. In the `Connections` bar, pick your site below `Sites`, or choose the top
   level entry if you want to modify the machine-wide settings.
#. Choose the `Handler Mappings` feature click `PHP_via_fastCGI`.
#. Choose `Request Restrictions` and find the `Verbs` tab.
#. Ensure `All Verbs` is checked.
#. Click `OK`.
#. Next, choose `Request Filtering` feature from IIS Manager.
#. Ensure that all verbs are permitted (or none are forbidden) in the `Verbs`
   tab.

Also, ensure that you did not enable the WebDAV authoring module, since ownCloud
needs to be able to handle WebDAV on the application level.


Configuring ownCloud, PHP and IIS for Large File Uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before going too nuts on ownCloud, it is important to do a couple of
configuration changes to make this a useful service for you. You will probably
want to increase the **max upload size**, for example. The default upload is
set to **2MB**, which is too small for even most MP3 files.

To do that, simply go into your **PHP.ini** file, which can be found in your
**C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PHP** folder. In here, you will find a **PHP.ini**
file. Open this in a text editor, and look for a few key attributes to
change:

+ **upload_max_filesize** – change this to something good, like 1G, and you
  will get to upload much larger files.
+ **post_max_size** – also change this size, and make it larger than the max
  upload size you chose, like 1G.

There are other changes you can make, such as the timeout duration for
uploads, but for now you should be all set in the **PHP.ini** file.

Now you have to go back to IIS manager and make one last change to enable file
uploads on the web server larger than 30MB.

1. Go to the start menu, and type **iis manager**.
2. Open IIS Manager Select the website you want enable to accept large file
   uploads.
3. In the main window in the middle double click on the icon **Request
   filtering**.
4. Once the window is opened you will see a bunch of tabs across the top of the
   far right,

   Select :guilabel:`Edit Feature Settings` and modify the :guilabel:`Maximum
   allowed content length (bytes)`

5. In here, you can change this to up to 4.1 GB.

.. note:: This entry is in BYTES, not KB.

You should now have ownCloud configured and ready for use.
